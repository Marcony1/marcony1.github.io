I come from Puebla, a beautiful city located in the center of Mexico, my beloved homeland. I graduated from Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP), presumably, the best Mexican university (please don’t tell Alexi, haha). I did my undergrad in Actuarial Sciences and I have currently passed 3 SOA exams (P, FM and IFM). I also hold a Master’s Degree in Corporate Finance from that same university. I’ve worked for over 7 years as State Co-Delegate for the Mexican Mathematical Olympiad. In the last two years I’ve worked as a Data Analyst/Junior Data Scientist, and I’ve been professor at UDLAP.\nI don’t know if other MDS students will actually visit this website in the coming days.
