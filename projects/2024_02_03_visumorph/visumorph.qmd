## Features
<div style="text-align: justify;">
VisuMorph includes a variety of functions for image manipulation:

- Flipping(flip): Horizontally or vertically flip images, useful for creating mirror effects or correcting orientation.
- Rotating(rotate): Rotate images by a specified degree, supporting both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations.
- Hue Change(change_hue): Adjust the hue of images, allowing for color shifting and mood setting in visuals.
- Scaling(scale): Resize images, either uniformly or non-uniformly, without losing the essence of the visual content.

## Position in the Python Ecosystem
<div style="text-align: justify;">
VisuMorph, while a robust tool for image manipulation, is designed primarily as an educational project for the 524 course in the Master of Data Science program. It serves as an introductory tool for those beginning their journey in data science and image processing. While it offers a range of functionalities, it is more limited in scope compared to professional-grade packages like PIL (Python Imaging Library) and OpenCV. These larger libraries offer a wider range of complex functionalities and are suited for industrial applications. However, VisuMorph stands out for its simplicity and ease of use, making it an excellent starting point for students and hobbyists looking to understand the basics of image manipulation in Python.
