During my time as a Data Scientist at DataKnow, I led end-to-end projects on predictive modeling and machine learning. One of these had the purpose of fighting against Money Laundering and Terrorism by using and evaluating  the performance of clustering algorithms where NLP and text mining were key in extracting useful information from the data. The whole workflow of the project was designed from scratch, from the obtaining of the raw data, its standardization through null and outlier handling, its classification for further processing, and the delivery of key insights, an artifact and documentation to the stakeholders.
